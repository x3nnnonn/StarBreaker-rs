# StarBreaker Blender Addon — AI Agent Instructions

Project-wide notes live in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). This file covers
the Blender addon specifically: target versions, layout, deploy flow,
tests, and hard-won lessons about driving Blender from an agent.

## Target Blender

- **Latest LTS** and **latest release** — currently Blender 5.1.x.
  Cycles is the priority renderer; EEVEE parity should be considered
  where it's cheap, but do not compromise Cycles output for it.
- Python 3.13 (bundled with Blender 5.1).
- The addon loads as an extension under
  `~/.config/blender/5.1/scripts/addons/starbreaker_addon/` on Linux.
  Point-version bumps (5.2, 5.3, …) change the path; update the deploy
  command below if the user moves to a newer Blender.

### PackageImporter composition (runtime/importer/)

`PackageImporter` is composed from mixins in this order:
`(PaletteMixin, DecalsMixin, LayersMixin, MaterialsMixin,
BuildersMixin, GroupsMixin, OrchestrationMixin)`.

Orchestration owns `create_light`, interior placement, and the
top-level import loop. When adding a new per-entity behaviour, add it
as its own mixin rather than bloating orchestration.

## Coding Practices

See the project-wide `Coding Practices` section in
[../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Addon-specific reinforcements:

- **Keep module files small.** The addon already splits imports into
  mixins and runtime helpers; when a file passes ~500 lines, extract
  a sibling module (`runtime/<thing>_utils.py`) or a new mixin
  instead of letting it grow.
- **Prefer the runtime helpers.** `runtime/node_utils.py`,
  `palette_utils.py`, and `record_utils.py` exist so operators and
  mixins stay focused on orchestration. Reach for them before
  inlining ad-hoc node or palette code.
- **Tune via `runtime/constants.py`.** Visible knobs
  (`LIGHT_VISUAL_GAIN`, `LIGHT_CANDELA_TO_WATT`, shadow-radius
  floors, custom-property names) live there. Never hard-code a
  magic number inside a mixin.
- **Never leave the scene dirty for the next test.** If an operator
  mutates `bpy.data` in a way that another test might observe,
  unwind it or use `bpy.ops.wm.read_homefile(app_template="")`
  between fixtures.

## Deploy (rsync)

The installed copy must stay in lockstep with the source tree or the
MCP bridge will execute stale code. After every change:

- **Always sync the live Blender install before asking the user to test.**
  Repo-only edits are not enough; Blender will keep running the installed
  copy until the add-on directory below is updated.

```bash
rsync -a --delete StarBreaker/blender_addon/starbreaker_addon/ \
  ~/.config/blender/5.1/scripts/addons/starbreaker_addon/
```

`--delete` is important: it removes stray stale `.py` files (deleted
modules, renamed files) that would otherwise shadow the new code.

After `rsync`, force-reload the addon in Blender before validating
behavior. Even with synced files, Python module caching can keep stale
function objects alive until the reload sequence in
"Reload the addon after deploy" is run.

## Running the Tests

The suite stubs `bpy` so it runs on system Python, not inside Blender:

```bash
cd StarBreaker/blender_addon
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -q
```

Baseline: **54 tests ran, 0 failures, 0 errors, 20 skipped**. Keep
this green after every change. Skipped tests require a real `bpy` and
only run under Blender — do not try to make them pass headless.

## Driving Blender from an Agent (MCP)

The `mcp_blendermcp_execute_blender_code` tool runs Python inside a
connected Blender instance. A few rules that have burned us:

### ALWAYS reset the scene this way

```python
import bpy
bpy.ops.wm.read_homefile(app_template="")
```

**Do NOT** try to clear the scene by hand (`bpy.data.objects.remove`
loops, `bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings`, scene unlinks, etc.).
`read_homefile(app_template="")` is the only path that reliably
restores a clean Blender default without leaving orphaned data,
broken templates, or unregistered addons. Everything else either
leaves residue (lights, world, view layers, node groups) or crashes
Blender outright.

### Reload the addon after deploy

When iterating, modules get cached:

```python
import sys, bpy
for name in [n for n in sys.modules if n.startswith("starbreaker_addon")]:
    del sys.modules[name]
try:
    bpy.ops.preferences.addon_disable(module="starbreaker_addon")
except Exception:
    pass
bpy.ops.wm.read_homefile(app_template="")
bpy.ops.preferences.addon_enable(module="starbreaker_addon")
```

Without the `sys.modules` purge, `importlib.reload` is not enough —
sub-modules keep serving stale code.

### Purge orphaned data between imports

**Always reset the scene before importing a ship** — even if it looks
empty. Leftover `SB_*` / `POM_*` / `StarBreaker*` node groups and
`__host_*` materials can silently poison the new import, and the only
reliable way to drop them is the scene reset:

```python
import bpy
bpy.ops.wm.read_homefile(app_template="")
```

Do NOT write by-hand cleanup loops (`bpy.data.node_groups.remove`,
`bpy.data.materials.remove`, selection-based deletes, etc.) — they
miss hidden users, leave orphaned drivers, and get out of sync with
new datablock categories. `read_homefile(app_template="")` is the
single source of truth for "start from a clean slate".

### Import a ship

```python
bpy.ops.starbreaker.import_decomposed_package(
    filepath="<path to a decomposed scene.json>",
)
```

Decomposed exports put the ship `scene.json` under a
`<output>/Packages/<name>/scene.json` layout. The CLI's `<output>`
argument is the **shared export root** (the parent that holds
`Packages/` and the deduplicated `Data/` tree), **not** the package
folder itself.

Canonical target for this workspace: pass `ships` as the output so
Aurora lands at `ships/Packages/RSI Aurora Mk2/scene.json` and all
shared meshes/textures/materials land in `ships/Data/...` for reuse
across ships. Do **not** pass `ships/Packages/RSI Aurora Mk2` — that
produces a double-nested `ships/Packages/RSI Aurora Mk2/Packages/RSI
Aurora Mk2/scene.json`.

```bash
SC_DATA_P4K="…/Data.p4k" \
  StarBreaker/target/release/starbreaker entity export "aurora_mk2" \
  "ships" --kind decomposed --lod 0 --mip 0 --materials all
```

Point the Blender import operator at the resulting `scene.json`, not
the outer folder.

### MCP output size

`execute_blender_code` will spill to a temp JSON file if stdout is
big. Keep probes targeted; filter with list comprehensions before
printing.

## Light Pipeline (current, post-Phase 28)

- Exporter emits `color`, `intensity` (cd), `temperature` (K),
  `use_temperature`, `radius`, `inner_angle`, `outer_angle`,
  `projector_texture`, `active_state`, `states` on every light.
- Addon stashes the full state map as JSON on the `bpy.types.Light`
  datablock: `starbreaker_light_states`,
  `starbreaker_light_active_state`.
- Energy conversion (runtime/constants.py):
  - Point / Spot / Area: `energy_W = intensity_cd * (4π/683) * LIGHT_VISUAL_GAIN`
    with `LIGHT_VISUAL_GAIN = 20.0`.
  - Sun: `energy_W_per_m2 = intensity / 683`.
  - Tune `LIGHT_VISUAL_GAIN` in `constants.py` if scenes are dim/bright.
- Runtime state switcher: `STARBREAKER_OT_switch_light_state` (N-panel
  buttons) calls `runtime.package_ops.apply_light_state(name)` which
  reapplies colour, temperature, and energy per light from the
  chosen state. Lights that lack that state keep their current values.

See the workspace-root `AGENTS.md` for the full light-schema notes and
per-phase history (stored outside this repo).

## Material Pipeline Notes

- **Glass** is rendered double-sided and uses a Light Path trick to
  stay visible through stacked interior+exterior panes (Phase 20, 26).
- **POM decals** gate host-material tinting: decals with POM height
  inherit the host palette; flat MeshDecals do not (Phases 10, 11, 16).
- **Shimmerscale paint** green channel is documented as engine-authored
  teal (Phase 12). Primary channel handling uses palette tint as the
  dominant colour (Phase 13).
- **Interior palette** routes through the exterior palette for
  specific ship parts (chairs) that DataCore marks as interior-paint
  targets (Phases 14, 21).
- POM node groups collapse to a small fixed set instead of one per
  texture (Phase 17).
- All imported meshes get a **Weighted Normal modifier** (Face Area,
  Weight=50, Threshold=0.01) to smooth shading across flat faces
  (Phase 19).

See `../docs/blender-material-contract-naming-rules.md` for the
in-repo material contract. Higher-level material research lives in
the workspace-root `AGENTS.md`.

## Phased Plan

The live plan lives in the workspace (outside this repo) — see the
workspace-root `AGENTS.md` for the path. Each phase has Context /
Acceptance / Steps sections and is marked `✅` when landed with a
commit hash. When starting a new phase, re-read the most recent
completed phase for conventions, then update the todo file as you go.
